## Call for Posters

We are excited to announce our LLM Agent Workshop on May 2-3.

Our workshop is a CMU-wide event for students to show their recent and/or ongoing research and projects to the community. Any work related to LLM situating in, perceiving, and acting upon an external environment is welcomed. 
Submissions from students will be presented at the poster session in our workshop. This would be a great opportunity to publicize your projects and gain valuable feedback from the community!

### Important Dates
* Submission Deadline: *Apr 30, 2024*
* Presentation Time/Date: *May 2nd, 2024, 3:00-5:30 pm*. In-person at [Cohon University Center, Rangos Ballroom 1](https://www.cmu.edu/cohon-university-center/images/floor-plans/CUC_2.pdf)


### Submission Format
Please prepare materials in the following two formats:
1. A poster in the .pdf format, with any reasonable size, landscape or portrait (you can print out your slides if you are feeling lazy :)).
2. A short abstract of your work

Youâ€™re welcome to submit projects at any stage, including side projects, submissions to other conferences, course projects, and any ongoing projects.

Please submit your project via this google form: https://forms.gle/sWgMhXrjX4cnoiGA8 , and bring your poster. It can be printed via [Tartan Ink](https://www.cmu.edu/tartanink/) or [SCS Poster Printing](https://computing.cs.cmu.edu/desktop/printing-posters) if you are part of SCS community. If for some reason you are unable to print the poster, please email us notifying this!


### Topics of Interest
Topics include, but are not limited to:

* LLM agents, environments, and tool use
* LLM reasoning
* LLM agents learning: expert supervision, reinforcement learning, synthetic data augmentation, etc.
* Open source software of LLM tool use and agents: browser plugin, AI assistant, toolbox, environment, framework, etc.
* Multi-agent interaction: human agent and model-based agent
* Specific interesting tasks and domains: e.g., knowledge exploration, software engineering, scientific discovery, social intelligence
* Safety of LLM agents
* Ethics and societal impact of LLM agents: job market, economic impact, accessibility, etc.
