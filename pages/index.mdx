- LLM with tool use (LLM reasoner + environment receptor)
- LLM agents (+environment actuator)
- Tasks and Domains that are interesting (knowledge exploration, software engineering, clerk work, medical, robotics, enabling scientific discovery, social agents etc.)
- Learning of LLM agents (expert supervision, reinforcement learning, weak supervision, synthetic data, environment generation and augmentation, etc.)
- Open source software of LLM tool use and agents (e.g. browser plugin, AI assistant, toolbox, environment, framework, etc.)
- Multi-agent interaction, human-agent interaction, socially-intelligent Agents.
