# Poster Session
## Call for Posters

We are excited to announce our LLM Agent Workshop on May 2-3.

Our workshop is a CMU-wide event for students to show their recent and/or ongoing research and projects to the community. Any work related to LLM situating in, perceiving, and acting upon an external environment is welcomed. 
Submissions from students will be presented at the poster session in our workshop. This would be a great opportunity to publicize your projects and gain valuable feedback from the community!
